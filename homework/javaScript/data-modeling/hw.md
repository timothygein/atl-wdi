# Data Modeling with JavaScript

Every computer program deals with managing data. How you choose to represent
these data within your program can have far-reaching implications on every other
part of your application; consequently, reversing those decision becomes more
and more costly over time, as the program becomes more complex. For this reason,
thinking carefully in advance about how you want to model your data within your
application can pay very big dividends.

## Choosing Entities/Abstractions

One of the first challenges in modeling data is deciding what data to model.
Let's consider a specific example: a laptop. Suppose that you need to represent
a laptop in an application. What attributes are most important to include in our
data model?

As it turns out, the answer to that question depends heavily on what the
application will do and how it will be used. If the application is for selling
laptops, we might be pick the following attributes.

  > A Laptop has...
  > - a sale price
  > - a brand name
  > - an amount of RAM, in GB
  > - a disc size, in GB
  > - a processor speed, in GHz
  > - a monitor size, in inches
  >
  > e.g.

  ```js
  var laptop = {
    salePrice: 1000,
    brand: 'Lenovo',
    RAM: 8,
    disc: 60,
    processor: 2.5,
    monitorSize: 12
  }
  ```

However, if the application will be used for _manufacturing laptops_,
things like sale price suddenly become much less relevant; instead, a laptop in
that kind of app might have information about materials costs, % completion,
or the factory and assembly line on which the laptop was built.

Take a look at each of the app descriptions below. For each description,
create a rough data model for the app by listing at least two relevant
entities/abstractions (e.g. Laptop, above) that the app might use, and giving
them each several properties that make sense for that use case.
Please also give a short explanation (1 - 2 sentences) of why these choices make
sense for the use case of the app.

### 1. To-Do List

This app will be an app for tracking and managing tasks. Not only will it keep
track of whether tasks have been completed, it will also keep track of
how long each task took to complete. Tasks can be grouped into 'projects' to
keep them organized.

>  var task = {
    title: "My to-do list";
    date-started: "04/14/2016";
    date-completed: "04/15/2016";
    duration: "24 hours";
  }

    var projects = {
    title: "my to-do project";
    description: "my big project";
    setOfTasks: "list of various tasks";

    }

### 2. Photo Sharing App

Having an account would require a username to state who is uploading a set of photos/albums to the specific account. Organizing these photos would require different albums labeled with names. Once the photo is uploaded, it owuld require a description, a date, and a URL to find the specific picture. By doing this, we are strictly organizing different uploads as well as securing them for the specific user who uploaded the photos.

let  photo = {
  name: 'photo from new room';
  description: 'new and reorganized';
  url: "insert link here";
};

let album = {
  name: 'Trip to the Home';
  setOfPhotos: ['set1', 'set2', 'set3'];
};

const user = {
  username: 'timothygein';
  password: 91password;
  dateuploaded: 06/27/2007;

### 3. Home Automation Manager

This app will be a tool for managing a home automation system; it will keep
track of the time and temperature of the house that it monitors, and use that
information to turn on and off different lights and adjust the thermostat up
and down.

> Different lights have different brightness levels as well as locations and names. Same goes for homes having different temperatures and sets of lights. 

var light = {
  levelOfBrightness: 'dim',
  location: 'bathroom',
  name: 'overhead'
};

var homeSystem = {
  temp: '98 degrees',
  setOfLights: ['bathroom', 'sun room', 'master bedroom']
};

### 4. Sneaker Store

This app will allow customers to browse a list of products (sneakers, in this
case), add those products to a cart, and save that cart as a past order once the
purchase is complete.

>  Different products have different names and descriptions with the price varying on the type of product you choose. Order items only come in bulk when you order the product. Every order comes with a set of order items, the status of the order, and an estimated date/time of arival. 

var product = {
  name: 'Manhunt',
  description: 'The greatest game you will ever play',
  price: '$29.99'
};

var XboxOrder = {
  product: 'Xbox System',
  quantity: 1
};

var order: {
  setOfOrderItems: [xboxOrder],
  status: 'shipped',
  dateCompleted: 'incomplete'
};

## Representing Abstractions in Code

Once you've chosen the abstractions that your app will use, the next step is to
figure out how to actually represent those abstractions in code. The same
abstraction can often be represented in multiple different ways, and there may
be trade-offs in speed and simplicity that come from using one representation
vs another.

### 5. Subway System

Suppose that you're building an app that tells travelers how many stops they
need to travel to get from one station to another. Two abstractions that you
decide to use to model your application's data are Stations and Rail Lines, with
the following properties:



The team has decided to represent these abstractions in the following way.

```js
// Station
var exampleStation = {
  name: 'Downtown Crossing',
  description: "Downtown Crossing is a shopping district that is a small part of downtown Boston, Massachusetts, located due east of Boston Common and west of the Financial District..."
};

// Rail Line
var exampleLine = {
  name: 'Green Line',
  northStation: {
    name: 'North Station',
    description: "North Station is a major transportation hub located at Causeway and Nashua Streets in Boston, Massachusetts, United States...."
  },
  haymarket: {
    name: 'Haymarket',
    description: "Haymarket is an MBTA subway station serving the Green and Orange lines, located at the corner of Congress and New Sudbury streets in downtown Boston, Massachusetts...."
  },
  governmentCenter: {
    name: 'Government Center',
    description: "Government Center is an area in downtown Boston, centered on City Hall Plaza. Formerly the site of Scollay Square, it is now the location of Boston City Hall..."
  }
};

// Stop and line descriptions from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org)
```

An advantage would be giving you the exact time of your arival so you can better prepare for travel. A disadvantage would be it not telling you if there are obstructions up ahead that could delay your arival time.

### 6. Doctor Appointment App

Consider an app for helping patients and doctors schedule appointments.

A Patient has:
-   a given name
-   a surname
-   a date of birth

A Doctor has:
-   a given name
-   a surname
-   a specialty
-   an address

An Appointment has:
-   a date
-   a time

The team has not yet decided how to represent the relationship between doctors,
patients, and appointments, so they've put together two different
alternatives.

#### Option 1

```js
var examplePatient = {
  givenName: 'John',
  surname: 'Doe',
  dateOfBirth: '1992-11-03'
};
var exampleAppointment = {
  date: '2016-12-15',
  time: '13:00',
  patient: {
    givenName: 'Jane',
    surname: 'Doe',
    dateOfBirth: '1980-06-13'
  }
};
var exampleDoctor = {
  givenName: 'Alphonse',
  surname: 'Cula',
  specialty: 'phlebotomy',
  appointments: [
    {
      date: '2015-10-31',
      time: '00:00',
      patient: {
        givenName: 'Lucy',
        surname: 'Westenra',
        dateOfBirth: '1976-06-06'
      }
    },
    {
      date: '2016-10-31',
      time: '00:00',
      patient: {
        givenName: 'Mina',
        surname: 'Murray',
        dateOfBirth: '1989-09-09'
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

#### Option 2

```js
var exampleDoctor = {
  givenName: 'John',
  surname: 'Dorian',
  specialty: 'internal medicine'
};
var examplePatient = {
  givenName: 'Jordan',
  surname: 'Sullivan',
  dateOfBirth: '1978-12-01'
};
var exampleAppointment = {
  date: '2009-04-15',
  time: '19:00',
  doctor: {
    givenName: 'Jan',
    surname: 'Itor',
    specialty: 'psychology'
  },
  patient: {
    givenName: 'Ladinia',
    surname: 'Williams',
    dateOfBirth: '1980-01-01',
  }
}
```

What are some relative advantages and disadvantages of each representation?
Under what circumstances might one representation be a better choice than the
other? Are there any circumstances in which the other representation might be
the better choice?

> roots representation inside reputation although there may be confusion about which doctor is for which patient

## Tying It Together

### 7. Tic-Tac-Toe

You've been tasked with building an in-browser tic-tac-toe game.

a.  What are some possible entities that your application might use to model its
    data? Please pick at least two, with at least two properties apiece.

  > calculating three-in-a-row is a little easier. 
  it allows you to perfectly reconstruct the history of the game
